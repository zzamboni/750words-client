;;; Commentary:

;; An Org exporter which converts Org to Markdown and posts it to 750words.com.

;; See https://github.com/zzamboni/750words-client for full usage instructions.

;;; Code:

(require '750words)
(require 'ox-md)

(org-export-define-derived-backend '750words 'md
  :menu-entry
  '(?m 1
       ((?7 "Post to 750words.com"
            (lambda (_a s v _b) (org-750words-export-to-750words s v))))))

(defun org-750words-export-to-750words (subtreep visible-only)
  "Post Org text to 750words.com.

The Org buffer is first converted to Markdown using ox-md, and
the result posted to 750words.com.

When optional argument SUBTREEP is non-nil, export the sub-tree
at point, extracting information from the headline properties
first.

When optional argument VISIBLE-ONLY is non-nil, don't export
contents of hidden elements."
  (let* ((outfile (make-temp-file "ox-750words"))
         (org-export-with-smart-quotes nil))
    (org-export-to-file 'md outfile nil subtreep visible-only)
    (750words-file outfile)))
